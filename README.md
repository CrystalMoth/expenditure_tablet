The WORK_TABLET let's the user keep a record of any activity over a day/week and month as well as the salary they will/would have earned given that the activity is considered 'work'

The WORK_TABLET gives the user a list of options and the user chooses how they will proceed

Examples of this might include: The Ability to add, remove and update time spent on the activity, update given salary, display a complete view of work done and/or salary earned

    Goal(s): 
        The core of the program is to keep track of time spent on an activity

        The program has to be able handle many types of minute to hour convertions

        The user should NEVER be confused about what the program is executing, asking and displaying

        The language used has to be 100 % Python (until further notice)
